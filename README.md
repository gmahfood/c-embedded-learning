# C/C++ Embedded Systems Learning Journey 🔧

> Learning C/C++ from the ground up with embedded systems as the goal — following K&R, Jacob Sorber, and building toward bare-metal development.

## 👋 About This Repo

This is my personal learning repository documenting my journey from little C knowledge to embedded systems development. I'm working toward writing firmware, understanding microcontrollers at the bare-metal level, and eventually developing real embedded projects.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Phase 1 — C Fundamentals *(current)*
- [x] Variables, data types, operators
- [x] Control flow (if, loops, switch)
- [ ] Functions and scope
- [ ] Arrays and strings
- [ ] Pointers and memory
- [ ] Structs, enums, unions
- [ ] File I/O
- [ ] Bitwise operations

### Phase 2 — C++ for Embedded
- [ ] Classes and objects
- [ ] RAII and resource management
- [ ] Templates (basics)
- [ ] What to avoid in embedded C++ (exceptions, dynamic allocation)

### Phase 3 — Microcontroller Fundamentals
- [ ] GPIO
- [ ] Timers and interrupts
- [ ] UART / SPI / I2C communication
- [ ] ADC / DAC
- [ ] First project on STM32 Nucleo

### Phase 4 — RTOS & Systems Concepts
- [ ] FreeRTOS basics (tasks, queues, semaphores)
- [ ] Memory-mapped I/O
- [ ] Linker scripts
- [ ] Bootloaders

### Phase 5 — Real Projects
- [ ] Sensor data logger
- [ ] Motor controller
- [ ] Custom bootloader

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| VS Code | Editor |
| PlatformIO | Embedded dev environment |
| Clang (Xcode CLI Tools) | C/C++ compiler |
| GDB + OpenOCD | Debugging |
| STM32 Nucleo | Target hardware (Phase 3+) |

**macOS setup:**
```bash
xcode-select --install   # installs clang
```

**Compile and run a file:**
```bash
clang filename.c -o filename && ./filename
```
